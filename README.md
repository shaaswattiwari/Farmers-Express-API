Rest API based application with MongoDB as the database and user friendly front-end for sending POST and GET requests along with JEST testing environment.

The application is deployed on heroku so it is directly assessable on https://farmers-express.herokuapp.com/
I have a free heroku account so loading time is more in first attempt.
